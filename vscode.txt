i think VI and Emacs are the only two text places i've ever been that
this doesnt work.. it works in Chrome, Notepad, Kate, KEdit etc

yeah it should be able to work if you tweak the terminal, which term
emulator do you use?

my box is always headless sometimes i'll start xterm though and have
it send to me windows X server emulator

and i can exit Emacs with "Alt-FunctionKey4" or"Alt f x" .. rather
than Ctrl-Z .. kill -9 %1 ?

btw, just fill me in on any other keybindings, I'll try to implement
them all.  Also, I will try to find a list of keybindings for vscode
and do them.

yeah I'll put Ctrl-Z to undo

"alt f x" usually means "(f)ile->e(x)it" but jsut ALt-F4 is good
enough

btw, I found someone who had bound C-c v to vscode-mode, but couldn't
find the mode they were referencing there.  So I created a new issue.
asking for access.

I want this to be as cozy a mode as possible

there are also extant vscode Emacs themes, that I can set up for you ,
like dark-mode so we'll play around to get it all correct

I'll install vscode too, and we'll do lsp stuff

hehe i only use light themes in vscode if i change the theme at
all.. i puicked vscode since it has all teh universal keys from 1984
wordprocessors

strange that emacs is lacking it, and I apologize in advance if some
of them are simply impossible to fix

all text editors and programs in Gnome, KDE and Windows 3.1-windows 10
all use this same keybinding set from 1985 that was used in
WordPerfect
